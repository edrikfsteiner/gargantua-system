A very simple project that simulates a fictional stellar system, using only and pure HTML and CSS. The system is based upon the Gargantua System from the Interstellar movie, with the planets Miller, Edmund and Mann in the first, second and third orbits respectively. The orbits and object sizes are not scaled relatively to reality.

These are the objects that orbit the Gargantuan Black Hole:

1- Miller (rocky, oceanic planet)
2- Pantagruel (neutron star)
  2.1- Edmund (Habitable exoplanet)
3- Mann (rocky, ice planet)
4- Panurge (Red-dwarf star)
  4.1- Zerathia (rocky, hot planet)
  4.2- Kytheron (Gas giant)
  4.3- Pannotia (rocky, cold planet)
  4.4- Eressea (Cold gas giant)
  4.5- Elunari (rocky, ice planet
  4.6- Neridia (Cold gas giant)
